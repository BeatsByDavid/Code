# Beats By David - Code

## About Us
Beats By David set out to solve a problem that all college students face, find a quiet, peaceful place to study. Students spend a ton of time search for places that have space, and are a comfortable environment. In our experience, we'll spend around 15 minutes walking all around campus in search for a place to study. By eliminating this arduous process of find someplace to study, we can increase the amount of time students spend studying and help them use their time more effectively.

To accomplish this task, we have developed a service that reports current and historic Sound and Temperature data from remote locations to users. Universities and departments can purchase or make these devices and place them around campus in areas that students are most likely to study. Students can then access a web page that displays this data, and will inform them about which place has the optimal conditions.

In our Beta phase, we made one hardware unit and took it around to different places in the CU Boulder Engineering Center. Students were able to go to https://beats.davidkopala.com/ to view the data that was being published. During our in class demonstration, we had the audience make a lot of noise, and there as a significant increase in the sound level that was displayed to the user.
